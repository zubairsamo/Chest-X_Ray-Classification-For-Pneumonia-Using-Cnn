# Chest-X_Ray-Classification-For-Pneumonia-Using-Cnn
Chest X_Ray Classification For Pneumonia Using Convolutional Neural Networks
## Project Description
The goal of this project is so classify the presence of pneumonia in a patient based off their chest x-ray. There are 3 different examples in the dataset (normal, bacterial pneumonia, and viral pneumonia). Our initial goal is to classify the yes/no question for if a patient has pneumonia. We will research a variety of models to see what is the most effective.
